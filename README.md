# EV3Web On-Robot Client

This client program relies on leJOS EV3. You'll need to install it, load the jar into the `programs` directory on the robot, and then run it. 

When compiling, make sure to set the correct address for the EV3Web server in the `ISPRobot` class.

**This is an amateur project that was created for fun. It doesn't have good security measures, sufficient safety programs, or anything else one would need in a production-ready product. Please use with caution.**
